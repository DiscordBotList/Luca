# Luca
Luca is the best bot you'll need for managing and informing members of the server
# Features
We have added all of the features from the actual dbl luca bot!
Such as -dotpost, everyone's favourite and -notr, another favourite
# Setup
Users are given this role when they are muted. 
The permissions may need extra setup in the channel overrides.
You may also make a channel called "mod-log", Luca will attempt to post logs in there, just like the official DBL bot
